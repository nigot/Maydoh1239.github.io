                Harriet Tubman was born into slavery sometime between 1820 and 1825. She was named Araminta Harriet Ross. Her father was Ben Ross, who was owned by Anthony Thompson, while her mother was Harriet "Rit" Green, owned by Mary Pattison brodess. Tubman escaped slavery in 1849, after the death of her owner. Instead of hiding away for the rest of her life, however, Tubman chose to help other slaves escape through the Underground Railroad, and participated in rerouting it to Canada following the passing of the Fugitive Slave Laws, and lead the Combahee River Raid, liberating more than 700 slaves and becoming the first woman to eer lead an armed expedition in war. Afterwards, she married Civil War veteran Nelson Davis and together they adopted a baby girl named Gertie.

                "I grew up like a neglected weed, - ignorant of liberty, having no experience of it. Then I was not happy or contented: every time I saw a white man I was afraid of being carried away. I had two sisters carried away in a chain-gang, - one of them left two children. We were always uneasy. Now I’ve been free, I know what a dreadful condition slavery is. I have seen hundreds of escaped slaves, but I never saw one who was willing to go back and be a slave. I have no opportunity to see my friends in my native land. We would rather stay in our native land, if we could be as free there as we are here. I think slavery is the next thing to hell. If a person would send another into bondage, he would, it appears to me, be bad enough to send him into hell, if he could."

                Frederick Douglass was born in 1818 a slave and died 1985 as one of the most influential abolitionists throughout the civil war. After escaping slavery at age 20, he wrote 3 autobiographies:
                <i> Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave</i> (1845)
                <i> My Bondage and My Freedom</i> (1855), and
                <i> The Life and Times of Frederick Douglass</i> (1881).
			Along with writing, he edited an influential black newspaper for 16 years. This got him international recognition as a both a great orater and writer. Frederick Douglass also supported the women's rights movement. He was among the only men present at the Seneca Falls convention, and even though he publicly disagreed with Mary Stanton and Susan Anthony, still supported women's suffrage. He felt that black rights were at the time more important than women's rights because of how bady they had been treated, while women weren't truly mistreated, just neglected.
