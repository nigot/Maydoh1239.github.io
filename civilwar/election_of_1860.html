			The election of 1860 had 4 candidates, <a href="leaders.html#abrahamlincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> representing the Republican Party, Stephen A. Douglas representing the Northern Democratic Party, John C. Breckinridge representing the Southern Democratic Party, and John Bell, representing the Constitutional Union Party. Lincoln recieved 40% of the popular vote and 180 electoral votes, and was successful. Even though Lincoln got less than half of the popular vote, the fact that the election had 3 other candidates present made it a crowded election where 40% was enough to win. Still, this meant that 60% of the population voted for someone other than Lincoln. This caused unrest in the South, leading to the <a href="secession">Southern Secession</a>.
