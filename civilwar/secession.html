                The first state to secede from the Union was South Carolina, on December 20, 1860. The state did so because citizens were worried that a Republican President would make efforts to abolish slavery, which was not wanted by the South. A total of 10 other states seceded from the Union. The first 6 were part of the deep south, with the most slaves. They were, in order: Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas. Adding South Carolina, which was first, made 7 states that were part of the deep south. Afterward, another 4 states seceded. They were, in order: Virginia, Arkansas, North Carolina, Tennessee. In the end, a total of 11 states seceded from the union, beginning with South Carolina on December 20, 1860 and ending with Tennessee on June 8, 1861. Soon after, the first (and last) Confederate President, Jefferson Davis, was elected on the 6th of November in 1861. He personally expressed his fear of the future containing "troubles and thorns innumerable". Jefferson Davis' term was to last 6 years as per the Confederate Constitution, but he never got to complete his term, with the Union winning the Civil War and dissolving the Confederate Government.

            <p><i>“The new constitution has put at rest, forever, all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institution African slavery as it exists amongst us the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution. Jefferson in his forecast, had anticipated this, as the “rock upon which the old Union would split.” He was right.”
