                Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, in Hodgenville, Kentucky. He grew up living near African Americans, both free and enslaved, which had a permanent impact on his views. This was evident, as he believed that if a slave was human, they were under the proclamation that all men were created equal, which was the view of most northerners. He was self taught, with little more than a year of formal schooling, but became a country lawyer and even won a case for a slave girl, Nancy, in 1839, letting her be freed in a historic court ruling. At age 52, he became inaugurated as the 16th president of the United States for the Republican party, which ultimately led to the <a href="secession">Confederate Secession</a> and the Civil War. On January 1, 1863, he issued the Emancipation Proclamation, declaring "that all persons held as slaves" in the rebellious states (confederacy) "are, and henceforward shall be free" (Abraham Lincoln, Emancipation Proclamation). After seeing the end of the Civil War, he was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth on April 14, 1865.

                Robert E. Lee was born on January 19, 1807, to revolutionary war hero Henry "Light-Horse Harry" Lee in Standford Hall, Virginia. Though financial hardship forced his father to move to the West Indies, Lee was able to get into United States Military Academy at West Point, and there he graduated second in 1829. In 1831, he married Mary Anna Randolph Custis, a descendant of John Parke Custis, who was George Washington's adopted son. After spending 17 years as an officer in the Corps of Engineers, he finally entered the battlefield during the war with Mexico in 1846. As part of General Winfield Scott's staff, Lee was quickly recognized, after earning three brevets for gallantry, and leaving the war as a colonel. He then served as superintendent of West Point from 1852 to 1855, teaching many of the men who would eventually fight for him and against him. He left West Point in 1855 to join the cavalry, and was involved in stopping John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry. His military skill was recognized by <a href="#abrahamlincoln"> Abraham Lincoln</a>, who offered Lee command of the Federal forces in april of 1861. Lee declined and resigned from the army following Virginia's secession on April 17, arguing that he could not fight against his own people. Instead, he joined the Confederate Army as a military advisor to president Jefferson Davis, until he was given command of the wounded General Joseph E. Johnson's army on the Virginia Peninsula. After stopping multiple attempts to take the Confederate Capital, Lee went on the offensive in September of 1862 with an invasion into Maryland to try to take the focus of the war off Virginia. Unfortunately, a misplaced dispatch outlining the invasion plan was discovered by Union commander George McClellan, removing the element of surprise, and the two armies fought in the <a href="antietam">Battle of Antietam</a>. On September 17, 1862, the two armies fought to a stalemate, but following the bloodiest single day battle of the entire Civil War, with heavy casualties, Lee was forced to withdraw under cover of darkness.
