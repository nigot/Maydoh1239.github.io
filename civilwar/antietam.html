                Major General George B. McClellan, leading the Union army of Potomac, confronted <a href="leaders#robertelee">Robert E. Lee</a>, leading his Army of Northern Virginia on September 16, 1862. At dawn on the 17th, Major General Joseph Hooker attacked Lee's left flank, marking the start of the Battle of Antietam, and the bloodiest day in American military history. Though the Union had by far more troops, Stonewall Jackson's troops at Bunker Church held their ground. Towards the center of the battlefield, Union attacks toward Sunken Road allowed them to pierce the center of Confederate troops, which was a key defensive postition. Unfortunately, this advantage was not followed up with further advances. Later in the day, Major General Ambrose Burnside's corps crossed a bridge over Antietam Creek and were able to put the Confederate Right at risk. At a crucial moment, A.P. Hill's division arrived from Harper's Ferry, and quickly launched a counterattack. The division drove back Burnside's corps and saved the day for Northern Virginia. The day after, even though there were huge casualties, Lee continued to battle with McClellan, leaving his wounded soldiers to the South of the Potomac. Even though McClellan didn't pursue the wounded Confederate army, and that the battle was considered a draw by military standards, it was still a win for Lincoln and the Union, as they were successful in driving Lee's confederate troops out of Maryland.

The number increased, and larger and larger grew the field of the blue until it seemed to stretch as far as the eye could see, and from the tops of the mountains down to the edges of the stream gathered the great army of McClellan."
