                Major General George B. McClellan, leading the Union army of Potomac, confronted <a href="leaders#robertelee">Robert E. Lee</a>, leading his Army of Northern Virginia on September 16, 1862. At dawn on the 17th, Major General Joseph Hooker attacked Lee's left flank, marking the start of the Battle of Antietam, and the bloodiest day in American military history. Though the Union had by far more troops, Stonewall Jackson's troops at Bunker Church held their ground. Towards the center of the battlefield, Union attacks toward Sunken Road allowed them to pierce the center of Confederate troops, which was a key defensive postition. Unfortunately, this advantage was not followed up with further advances.

The number increased, and larger and larger grew the field of the blue until it seemed to stretch as far as the eye could see, and from the tops of the mountains down to the edges of the stream gathered the great army of McClellan."
