        Harriet Tubman
    </h1>
    <p>
    Harriet Tubman was born into slavery sometime between 1820 and 1825. She was named Araminta Harriet Ross. Her father was Ben Ross, who was owned by Anthony Thompson, while her mother was Harriet "Rit" Green, owned by Mary Pattison brodess. Tubman escaped slavery in 1849, after the death of her owner. Instead of hiding away for the rest of her life, however, Tubman chose to help other slaves escape through the Underground Railroad, and participated in rerouting it to Canada following the passing of the Fugitive Slave Laws, and lead the Combahee River Raid, liberating more than 700 slaves and becoming the first woman to eer lead an armed expedition in war. Afterwards, she married Civil War veteran Nelson Davis and together they adopted a baby girl named Gertie.
